I used IDEAL to help me better define my goals for this problem. There was also a lot of trail and error for this problem since I needed to find the best way for me to count the bits while making sure the array kept track of them with each bit. With the Duke Steps, I focused on writing down my thoughts on paper first before moving onto writing the code down. Since I make a lot of errors as I'm thinking, it's easier for me to scratch it out or add stuff without having to necessarily start all over again if I had written the code off the bat.
One question that came to mind for this problem is wondering if there was a max amount of bits that was allowed? Since I decided to use an array, size isn't an issue until the amount of bits gets bigger. That really becomes a concern for storage if there is one to be had.
