This one really required me to do a lot of trail and error to get an idea on how to solve this problem. I started on a small problem first instead of trying to work on a more complex one because there's a lot to consider for this problem. Though I did do a lot of trail and error, I didn't have to do a lot in the way of writing in down compared to other problems. Mostly because with this, it was just a lot of small errors I needed to fix that I was able to catch better as I typed out the code. After working on the smallest problem I could think of, I was able work on expanding the problem more to deal with more strings in the wordDict.
One question I have for this problem is do all the words need to be used in the wordDict? From the examples, the ones that pass all used all of the words but from the one showing a fail, there were all technically used as well although they were smushed together rather than put next to each other.
