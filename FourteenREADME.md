Most of this problem involved me writing out multiple different solutions that didn't work very well and that was because I focused on the big problem with this one instead of initially trying to break it down to make it easier on myself. When I finally came back to it, I made sure to break down the problem and then it was just trail and error on making it as sound as I thought I could get it. Once I did that, working on the rest of the problem wasn't as bad. I also noticed that this problem seemed similar to previous ones I had worked on and used that to help me with this one.
Only had one question for this one which was are duplicates of the word allowed? They would be correct in this context because it wants anagrams but would that be unnecessary?
