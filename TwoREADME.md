#TwoREADME
Using IDEAL helped me to define that the biggest goal for this problem was to make sure not to include where we were in the array with the rest of the result. I had to make a lot of changes to the solutions because I was either adding the current spot or even multipling the same index more than once, giving me the wrong result.
With DUKE, I focused on breaking down the solution which helped me to see that breaking up it into checking the left and right sides of the current spot in the array and then multiplying them together instead of trying to figure our how to do that all in one for loop, assuming that was possible to do to begin with.
There were no questions for me to ask about this problem that weren't already addressed in the explaintion of the problem.
