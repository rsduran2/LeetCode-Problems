IDEAL and DUKE's were really helpful for this problem since there were so many things to consider. There were a lot of mistakes made as I tried to solve this problem. It took me some time to put the pieces together because of all the small problems I had to work on. I needed to find the best way to work with each of the numbers represting a string of letters that corresponded with them and at first I couldn't see a way to do so that wasn't slopy or really really long but as I kept trying I came to the solution for that. After that was making sure to store and make sure I did every possible combination with the numbers that could be given.
One question I had was are there always going to be only two numbers? The examples only ever showed two and although I'm not sure if that would change my code a whole lot, it was a question that I thought about.
