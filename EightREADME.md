I mostly focused on DUKE's for this problem although I did do some trail and error for this problem since it dealt with a 2D array and a 1D array. With the examples given, I worked it out with the solution given to get a better idea of how it could be searched properly. Still, despite some trail and error in the coding itself, the goal was easy to figure out and solving the problem wasn't too diffcult.
For this problem, I had two questions:
1) Can the 2D array be searched more than once? It doesn't say whether you can or can't but from one of the examples, it gave me the impression that you could.
2) Upper or lowercase? Does that mean that the letter has to match in that a = A or A==A. I know all the letters were uppercase but I wasn't sure if that meant anything.
