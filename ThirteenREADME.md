IDEAL and DUKE's helped me a lot with this problem since there was a lot to consider for it. I had put a lot of thought into how to read the string given in order to produce the right answer. I had to write down multiple ideas that I had to get the answer before I was able to come up with the best solution I could think of. I did have to go over my solution a couple of times to workout some of the small errors that would ultimately make my code not work at all. I also spent some time working out how to duplicate a letter because multiply a number by a letter doesn't produce the correct outcome.
Questions I had were, could there be a zero, does it have to be a specific bracket used, and could it be a double digit instead of just one?
