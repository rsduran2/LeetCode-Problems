For this problem, I didn't need to use IDEAL or Duke's very much just because this problem was pretty much straight forward in what it wanted. What was necessary was making sure of having a way to keep track of the first and last positions in relation to the target number. It was being careful in making sure that those positions actually marked the first and last instance of the target. 
However I did have a question on if multiple targets could be in the array? For example if we have [1,1,4,5,1,1,6] and the target was one, would we then need to show all those instances or will it always be one instance?
